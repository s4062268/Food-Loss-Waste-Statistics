Further, whilst Romeo has a decent understanding of tables and graphs, they often struggle with making that relation from a physical to online concept, and similarly struggle when it comes to sorting through tables and the likes.', 1);
INSERT INTO describedPersona VALUES ('Pains: Romeo often struggles on most sites as they are far too convoluted to be easily digested and navigated for them, making information far too difficult to obtain.

INSERT INTO describedPersona VALUES ('Needs & Goals: Julia needs to create a policy on behalf of the up and coming direct to consumer delivery service. To do so, they are looking to gather thorough information about specific foods, and which foods are most affected by which stages of the food supply chain. This will allow them to build policies surrounding how each food should be delivered, stored, and obtained. As Julia is the head researcher for statistics regarding the issue of food loss and waste, they must also gather various statistics about food loss and waste internationally, common trends and how that can be similarly displayed through specific foods in relation to the supply chain process, ultimately structuring a justification for why this new delivery system will benefit the social issue.', 3);

The lack of information makes it difficult for Julia to make a thorough policy statement and justification. The variety of pages similarly makes it difficult to complete work as Julia does not enjoy having to tab in and between many places at the same time.', 3);
